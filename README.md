# Parabolic-Acoustic-Mirror-Bearing-Dataset-PAM-Bearing-
本项目公开了基于抛物面声镜技术采集的滚动轴承声学数据集（PAM-Bearing），旨在为学术界与工业界提供高质量、可复现的研究资源，推动声学信息在滚动轴承状态监测（Condition Monitoring）与故障诊断（Fault Diagnosis）中的深入探索。
The dataset covers multiple operating speeds, fault types, and working conditions, enabling comprehensive studies in:
Acoustic signal enhancement and weak impulse extraction
Mirror-assisted intelligent fault diagnosis and deep learning models
Robustness, domain generalization, and variable-speed analysis
Non-contact acoustic condition monitoring under harsh environments

By releasing PAM-Bearing, we aim to provide a high-quality and reproducible benchmark that supports researchers and engineers in exploring signal processing, machine learning, deep learning, explainable diagnostics, and industrial acoustic sensing based on parabolic mirror technology. We hope this dataset will accelerate advancements in both theoretical research and practical deployment of acoustic monitoring systems.
