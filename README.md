# Parabolic-Acoustic-Mirror-Bearing-Dataset-PAM-Bearing-

The Parabolic Acoustic Mirror Bearing Dataset (PAM-Bearing) is an open-access acoustic dataset collected using a parabolic acoustic mirror, which significantly enhances the directionality and signal-to-noise ratio of bearing acoustic emissions. This dataset provides a high-quality foundation for academic research and industrial applications in condition monitoring and fault diagnosis.

The parabolic mirror–assisted acquisition setup enables the capture of weak, transient fault-induced impulses even under strong background noise. This dataset is ideal for exploring signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning approaches for intelligent acoustic diagnostics.
