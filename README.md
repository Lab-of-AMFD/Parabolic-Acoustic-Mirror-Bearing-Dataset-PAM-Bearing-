# Parabolic-Acoustic-Mirror-Bearing-Dataset-PAM-Bearing-

The Parabolic Acoustic Mirror Bearing Dataset (PAM-Bearing) is an open-access acoustic dataset collected using a parabolic acoustic mirror, which significantly enhances the directionality and signal-to-noise ratio of bearing acoustic emissions. This dataset provides a high-quality foundation for academic research and industrial applications in condition monitoring and fault diagnosis.

🚀 The dataset covers multiple operating speeds, fault types, and working conditions, enabling comprehensive studies in:

Acoustic signal enhancement and weak impulse extraction

Mirror-assisted intelligent fault diagnosis and deep learning models

Robustness, domain generalization, and variable-speed analysis

Non-contact acoustic condition monitoring under harsh environments
